# QuietScan

Today, people's daily lives are increasingly dependent on the Internet; similarly, all company operations are inseparable from the information technology department and their own networks. However, the development of information technology has also brought about many problems, and cyber-attacks are one of the biggest problems. The financial and reputational damage caused by cyber-attacks is growing, many companies are looking to improve their cybersecurity defenses with affordable and effective vulnerability scanners. Based on this demand, our team designed a vulnerability scanner--QuietScan.\

By using QuietScan, the tool's automated and systematic approach enables users to scrutinize their digital assets for potential security threats, empowering them to proactively mitigate risks and enhance their overall cybersecurity stance.
